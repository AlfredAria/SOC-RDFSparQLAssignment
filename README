Both HelloRDF and RDFSearchWebApp are Eclipse projects.
Compiled with idk 1.8 and RDFSearchWebApp is using Tomcat 8.

HelloRDF is a tool to convert DBLP XML dataset into RDF.
Configure the input and output file path with conversion.PathUtils
Run a conversion with conversion.ConvertXMLToRDF to generate the lab RDF output.

Run RDFSearchWebApp in Eclipse on a Tomcat 8 server.
Browse to localhost:8080/RDFSearchWebApp/index.html to interact with the RDF model.

The queries in the “console query” folder are hard-coded query parameters.
The queries used in the RDFSearchWebApp, however, are parameterized. Output is in “web ui query”.
